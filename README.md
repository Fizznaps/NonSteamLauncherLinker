# OriginSteamOverlayLauncher
How To Install/Uninstall
========================
This wrapper requires no installation other than copying it into the directory of the game executable you wish to run through Steam BPM/Overlay. It also can simply be deleted if you wish to uninstall it at any time.


How To Use
==========
* Place the "OriginSteamOverlayLauncher.exe" file in the directory with the game executable you wish to launch through Origin.
* Go into Steam and add the OriginSteamOverlayLauncher.exe as a Non-Steam Game, selecting it from the directory of the game executable you wish to run through Steam.
* Rename the shortcut in Steam to the name of the game in Origin so you can retrieve Steam Community Configurator Profiles.
* Launch the shortcut you've created and you'll be prompted to select the paths of the Origin Launcher (by default: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin\Origin.exe"), and the game executable you wish to use.
* This wrapper should run Origin (so Steam Overlay can hook into it) and then the game, and if everything went okay the Steam Overlay will appear in-game.

Thanks to Dafzor and his bnetlauncher wrapper (http://madalien.com/stuff/bnetlauncher/) for giving me the idea to make this.
